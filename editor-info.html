	<h4>The link below will open the PDDL Online Editor so that you can see an example of the PDDL Syntax Highlighting. It was created with the <a href="http://ace.c9.io/">Ace code editor</a>. Simply paste in your code or write a new domain or problem from scratch. Although it is a fully functional code editor, the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download.html">Plugin for Sublime Text</a> has many additional features.</h4>
	<h3>Important: The editor could take some time to load. However, if it is still not loaded after a longer period of time, please refresh the editor page and make sure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.</h3>
