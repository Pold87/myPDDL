You have to take a few more steps to enjoy all functionalities of myPDDL. I assume you are using Linux:

1) Go to the Sublime Text Packages folder in a (Preferences -> Browse Packages ...).
2) Go to the myPDDL folder.
3) Ensure the file myPDDL (inside the folder myPDDL) is executable (type `chmod a+x myPDDL` in your shell).
4) Place the file myPDDL somehwere on your $PATH (e.g. ~/bin) or add the the folder myPDDL to your $PATH (you can do this by adding `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/myPDDL-folder` to your ~/.profile file)
5) Open myPDDL in a text editor and customize it: While most options are for advanced users can should set the variable "path" to match the corresponding myPDDL folder. The default is probably right for you: "~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/myPDDL".
6) ENJOY:
   a) Create new projects -  open the command palette (*ctrl+shift+p*) and choose myPDDL-new. Specify the name for the project and press enter -> A new project structure with templates will be generated in your PDDL project directory (the project directory defaults to ~/Documents/myPDDL but you can choose a different folder in the file myPDDL.py - simply customize the variable "PDDL_project_root_folder"). 
   b) Switch to PDDL syntax highlighting: View -> Syntax -> PDDL  
   c) Use snippets: type domain and press tab -> a domain skeleton appears (you can find all snippets below)
   d) Display a PDDL type diagram: open the command palette (`ctrl`+`shift`+`p` and choose myPDDL-diagram)
   e) Calculate distances between PDDL predicates in a problem file specified by a predicate 'location' (you can choose a different name for this predicate in the myPDDL (NOT myPDDL.py) file in your $PATH). 

### Customization

You can customize almost anything. Use a different image viewer by changing the variable "viewer" in the myPDDL file on your $PATH or customize the templates for the domain files of myPDDL-new (in the folder templates). 

### Use Snippets

This package contains some often used PDDL constructs. Try one of the following, to see how they work:

* template: `domain`, `problem`
* types: `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, etc.
* predicates: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, etc.
* functions: `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, etc.
* action: `action`, `durative-action`

Examples
-----------

### Create PDDL Projects (myPDDL-new)

Within the project folder, the domain file domain.pddl and
the problem file p01.pddl (within the folder
problems/) initially contain corresponding PDDL skeletons
which can also be also customized. Additionally the project name is
used as the domain name within the files domain.pddl and p01.pddl.


### Type Diagram Generation (myPDDL-diagram)


Every time myPDDL-diagram is invoked, the names of the saved files are
extended by an ascending revision number. Thus, one cannot only
identify associated PDDL and diagram files, but also use this feature
for basic revision control.

### Distance Calculation (myPDDL-distance)

Before using the calculator the problem file looks like this (p01.pddl):
`(:init ...
       (location gary 4 2)
       (location pizza 2 3))`

After the application, the distances have been added in a new file (p01-location.pddl):
`(:init ...
       (location gary 4 2)
       (location pizza 2 3)
       (distance gary gary 0.0)
       (distance gary pizza 2.2361)
       (distance pizza gary 2.2361)
       (distance pizza pizza 0.0))`
