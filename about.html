About Me
========

I am a cognitive science at the University of Tuebingen, in my final semester. My bachelor thesis is about AI planning in household domains. In the course of my work, I had a lot to do with the planning domain language PDDL. As I couldn\'t find any fitting editor for this language, I wrote a plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3. This project will be kept online and cared of after the end of my undergraduate programm (31st of March 2014). If you have any questions, issues, please feel totally free to contact me.

My email address is [volker.strobel87@gmail.com](mailto:volker.strobel87@gmail.com).
