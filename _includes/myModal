				<p>The green link below will open the
				PDDL Online Editor so that you can see
				an example of the PDDL Syntax
				Highlighting. It was created with
				the <a href="http://ace.c9.io/">Ace
				code editor</a>. Simply paste in your
				code or write a new domain or problem
				from scratch. Although it is a fully
				functional code editor,
				<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download.html">myPDDL</a> has many
				additional features.</p>
				<p>Important: The editor could take
				some time to load. However, if it is
				still not loaded after a longer period
				of time, please refresh the editor
				page and make sure that JavaScript is
				enabled in your browser.</p>
